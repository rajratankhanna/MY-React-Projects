# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


This code defines a React application that renders a simple UI with a logo, tagline, main message, search bar, and footer. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:
🔹 Imports

The code imports:

    React for building the UI.
    UI components like Button, Input, Label, Card, and CardContent from a custom UI library.
    Icons from lucide-react (an icon library for React).

The import statement is optimized to reduce redundancy.
🔹 Main Component: App

This is the root component. It organizes the page into different sections:

    Logo
    Tagline
    MainMessage
    Subtitle
    SearchBar
    Footer

Each of these is a separate functional component.
