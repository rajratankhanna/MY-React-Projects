# MY-React-Projects
a React eCommerce website using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, featuring a modern and responsive design. The website should include:

    Fixed Header with a logo, navigation links, search bar, cart, and user icon.
    Hero Section with a background image, title, description, and a "Shop Now" button.
    Featured Categories displaying different product categories with images and hover effects.
    New Arrivals Section using Swiper.js to showcase a slider of new products, including images, titles, prices, and an "Add to Cart" button.
    Shopping Cart Indicator that updates dynamically when a product is added.
    Newsletter Subscription Form for users to enter their email and subscribe.
    Footer with quick links, customer service info, and social media icons.

The app should use React Hooks for state management and include interactive UI elements like hover effects, modals, and buttons.
